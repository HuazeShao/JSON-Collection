        Chinese people have been treating tea as a traditional beverage for a long time. The history of Chinese tea can be traced back to 3rd century BC, and it became popular among China due to various reasons, including its tastes, its medical functions, and its cultural meanings. There are many types of tea in China. They can be categorized into six major branches -- green tea, black tea, white tea, oolong, yellow tea, and dark green tea. Such a categorization is based on the technique that is utilized to make the tea. Even though all kinds of tea might be derived from the same tea plant, it is the technique that defines which kind of tea will tea leaves become.
